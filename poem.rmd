A bird came down the walk:  
He did not know I saw;   
He bit an angle-worm in halves  
And ate the fellow, raw.  

And then he drank a dew  
From a convenient grass,  
And then hopped sidewise to the wall  
To let a beetle pass.  

He glanced with rapid eyes  
That hurried all abroad,-   
They looked like frightened beads, I thought;   
He stirred his velvet head  

Like one in danger; cautious,  
I offered him a crumb,  
And he unrolled his feathers  
And rowed him softer home  

Than oars divide the ocean,   
Too silver for a seam,  
Or butterflies, off banks of noon,  
Leap, splashless, as they swim.

Emily Dickinson
